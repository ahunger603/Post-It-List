# Post-It-List
Open source productivity web app.



July 12th 2017 Week 3 Report:

The project has had its environment successfully created and it is able to run using Visual Studio. The start of API and Web app
was successfully created. The API supports adding a to-do item to a list of to-do items. The Web app, currently, has a home page, and a
second page that holds the list that a user creates. The Web app is able to add a list of to-do items without a page refresh and 
supports a button press that adds a item in the list. The model now has an id, completion status, and time to describe a task-list. 

The next focus point for week 4 is to get the API endpoints working with real data from the updated model. Currently the API only touches the key value. On the web side we're looking to do start working on more javascript with dummy data to implement our API interface, with actions such as edit and delete.
